# OOPJavaScript
A few examples of code to illustrate OOP in vanilla JS

These code examples come from my working through Brad Travery's Modern JavaScript course available on Udemy.com.

They are all in Section 5: Obect Oriented JavaScript - ES5 and ES2015.

The code is mainly working through the 'this' keyword, constructors, and Prototypes.  These are all ES5 concepts.

There is a folder on 'Classes', which is from ES6 onwards.

There will be a folder on Subclasses committed to this repository in the near future.
